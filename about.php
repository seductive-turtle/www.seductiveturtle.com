              <p>I am proudly and entirely a self taught programmer. I dropped out of Iowa State University after a year of the computer science program because I couldn’t learn in that environment. I’ve been programming since I was old enough to use a computer, with my first word being “Next”, I’ve been using computers all my life. I started HTML in elementary school, helping my family build a website (back in the Frontpage days).</p>
              
              <p>When I was 11 years old, my cousin and I started to build a Youtube like service for music on LAMP, but unfortunately didn’t go anywhere. From there, most of my programming was just for fun; making programs to help out some of the board games I played, like a networked bank program for Monopoly. After leaving college I got my first real LAMP job at a TV repair company called ShopJimmy, which really jump-started my career. I learned a lot about php, and object orient php while working at ShopJimmy. While I was there, I met fellow colleague Phil Gapp, and we had the idea of building a Forum based on the Zend Framework.</p>
              <p>I took what I learned at ShopJimmy, and I started my own company, Seductive Turtle. I was working with a business partner Phil Gapp, trying to build a framework that would allow average people to build their own website. Unfortunately, money ran out and I had to find a real job. I made my way back out to California, found a job at Underground Elephant in San Diego and started making a place for myself. I’ve moved from a Junior Web Developer, to a Senior Software Engineer and a Software Architect, leading the charge on the Project Development team at Underground Elephant.</p>
              <p>Community events are a new thing for me, but I’ve realized quickly how important they are, and how important it is to give back to the community, so here I am. I’ve gotten involved with the San Diego PHP meetup group, and im a co-organizer there now. I’m also a mentor with the group. If you are interested in the Mentorship program, click <a href="http://www.sdphp.org/sdphp-mentoring-program/">here</a>.</p>
              <p>Feel free to give me a shout if you need anything. I like to think that I’m a pretty decent programmer, and I’m also a really good dog sitter.</p>
